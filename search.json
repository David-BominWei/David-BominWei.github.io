He gave himself an English name called Apollo, which I thought a bit strange and funny, but he said the name came from Apollo the Moon Landing mission, and he thought it was cool.He adored me and always liked to tag along. No matter what I was doing, he would always follow, like a little tail that couldn’t be shaken off. I always ended up teaching him to do the things I do and later surprised to find myself good at teaching little kids. Figure. Apollo always loved to write and draw at the same desk by my side. Figure. Apollo always followed me to ball game trainings. He helped to get the balls back and sometimes we trained together. Many of his first-time-ever-in-life were also accompanied by me, like the first time stepping on the ice, the first time setting a fire, the first time catching a crab, and etc. I was also his first teacher for piano, swimming, board games and so many more. I believe I have rich repertoire with taking care of kids. Apollo was under a lot of separation anxiety when he first went to daycare. He didn’t ask for mom, but he asked for me to be his company. Figure. When I flew back from Australia after VEX competition, Apollo met me at the airport at 4 a.m. with a bouquet. One summer, I participated in an urban wildlife research activity and had to work in the fields installing infrared thermal cameras for a few days. Apollo insisted on following and promised to help. It was the hottest month in a year, and mosquitoes in the wild field are everywhere. He was wearing long sleeves and long pants despite the hotness, running around me in the field. Every day when we got home, mosquito bites were all over his chubby little face. I felt so concerned and wanted to stop him from going, and I said to him “Look, you are not actually helping me, but you are helping the mosquitos”. My little brother replied with great happiness, “Well, yes, I attracted the mosquitoes, and they are not coming for you”. I was ambivalent about his response with some flattered joy and concerned sadness. After I left for the United States for high school, we didn’t have much chance to be that close, but I always heard of him showing off that his older brother was capable of anything. When I learned that my almighty power included the trick of “fixing a broken mug with hot glue”, I wished I could fly back and cover his mouth. When I got home for winter vacation, he brought a classmate to me with a box of shattered mug. I was at a loss of words, but anyway I helped them restore the frame of the mug. It was not such a perfect repair that it would still leak and could no longer hold water. Still the two little ones were looking at me with genuine joy in their eyes, and that moment I found a true happiness more than ever. Every time when summer or winter break comes, I would participate, together with my brother Apollo, in volunteer activities hosted by Little Oak, which is a kindergarten care center we both attended. Even though it has been many years since our graduation, Little Oak will invite alumni families back and organize volunteer activities for public welfare and community service every year. My brother and I have always been involved in it. I also developed an information management system for the Center to automatically manage volunteer activities with user interfaces in both Wechat mini apps and webpages (). You can read about the team work, the design and the system architecture following this blog article (link: http….) . Figure: After Apollo’s birth, he always blew the candle together with me on every of my birthday. My brother Apollo is like a mirror for me, and the time I spent with him is like experiencing childhood once more. Looking back on the days with my little brother Apollo, it was not so much that I was the role model that my brother had always been proud of, but rather that his pure enthusiasm and divine kindness influenced me to hold more kindness to the world, inspiring me to be more patient and willing to help others, and always motivating me to take on things that I had not the courage to try before. He was my Apollo, a loving and daring mission to take on, a mission that helped me grow."},{"title":"O-A-K-Y","date":"2022-08-08T10:32:00.000Z","url":"/08/08/2022/20211025-4/","tags":[["Volunteer","/tags/Volunteer/"],["Community Services","/tags/Community-Services/"]],"categories":[["Growing up","/categories/Growing-up/"]],"content":"OAKY, that is our management system for Little’s Oak’s volunteer activities.

After the breakout of COVID-19 pandemic, I believe there is no time to waste to put the computational tools to work on fighting this pandemic. Around October in 2020, I attempted to use computational modeling to predict how COVID-19 case numbers add up with time. That was the first time I realized how simple computational tools can wonderfully work on real-life data and produce interesting results. Figure 1. The research poster on predicting COVID-19 case number increase using a combination of different models. The research poster was accepted by IEEE-ISEC 2021. Figure 2. The above poster won 1st place Best Poster Award in the Biology/Medicine category of the ISEC conference. () Can computational tools solve more complicated and more important problems of SARS-COV-2 virus genetic mutation? Around early 2021, news articles and research papers reported a lot of worrying discoveries. I learned how fast the virus was spreading because of mutations, which at the same time made COVID-19 escape vaccination and therefore hard to cure. I had a strong urge to find out if we can predict and thus potentially stop them. I learned interesting new science of ARIMA model and genetic mutations to worked out a model for short term mutation predictions. The manuscript of this project now appears on the preprint server bioRxiv at . Figure 3. Prediction of genetic mutations trends for high frequency mutation sites on the SARS-COV-2 genetic sequence. Yet the above research works are still observations and understandings of the situation. They are still far from a solution. To find a possible solution, I searched into the drug development processes for deeper understanding of the challenge. I was surprised to learn how long and costly drug developments are. Drug companies have prioritized the development of COVID-19 drugs, but their progress still is not fast enough. With knowledge from literature search and help from expert mentors, I decided to combine the latest deep learning technologies for drug repurposing predictions, which will predict whether a safe, existing drug can be used for a new disease such as COVID-19.

I talked with professionals from both research universities and industries about the drug repurposing project and learned about the research frontiers in the field. Figure 8.

The work will be presented and communicated in October, 2022, Washington D.C. Also the manuscript for this work is submitted on the preprint server bioRxiv at . I envision that the developed AI drug repurposing model can be directly used by drug developers such as pharmaceutical companies and lab experts to pick the best candidates from their pool of drugs, not only for COVID-19, but also for any target protein of diseases, because the model was optimized with in mind its ability to generalize to a broad application scenario. Also, the current AI model can run predictions on a personal laptop within hours.

A design of anti-aerodynamics motorcycle employs a smoothly curved body, originally prepared for aerodynamics. But it doesn’t follow the law in aerodynamics. What special about this design is, instead of dividing into different parts, this motorcycle design offered a new motorcycle approach that combined most of the pieces into a large smooth body. This can bring harmony to the motorcycle without losing any function. This is the design for a quadcopter for Space Y program, which should land on the top of towers with ease, under control and convenient for locating. All unnecessary parts are removed for lighter weight of the landing vehicle and therefore would lead to easier control. The final designed parts are light-weighted and simple. These are all the needed parts. Simple! Right? Design language is at times as important as the function. Pens are simple enough objects that are hard for new designs. Instead of making my design more simple or abstract, I would like to make it iconic and maximalism. I was able to produce a test product of the pen design.

This is the first time I am submitting to New York Time. My article is attached in the following.How can computer science accelerate efforts to combat Covid-19?At first sight, there seems to be no relationship between computer science and the battle with COVID-19. Generally, pharmacology research has focused on developing vaccines that may, in time, control, limit, and eventually eradicate the disease. Computer modeling offers an additional strategy, which has already proven itself in, for example, the fields of climatology and meteorology. So what is on offer?COVID-19 vaccines stimulate patients’ own immune system to produce antibodies so that most will suffer only mildly or even become immune. However, treatment is also needed for patients who have already been infected. However, gaining approval for new drugs can take years. But there are many drugs originally developed for treating other diseases, which may also prove effective in treating COVID-19. Remdesivir, for example, was originally developed to treat Hepatitis C; now, it is being repurposed to tackle other diseases like Ebola and Marburg Virus. Such drugs have already undergone clinical trials, are approved for use on human beings, and can be quickly deployed.Drug Target Interaction is one of the best computer science approaches to this kind of drug repurposing research. If a drug and its target virus interact, there is a high probability the drug can be used to cure the disease. Computer models - for example Deep PLA [1] - can calculate this probability by using existing binding data, with an accuracy rate of 82%, and, in test simulations, conduct such analysis for more than 3,000 drugs in an hour.This approach provides a number of collateral benefits. The most obvious advantage is the elimination of the cost of laboratory experimentation in a bio-secure environment. Another benefit is the encouragement of fruitful collaboration between global experts in related scientific disciplines. However, there are also disadvantages. Although computer modeling can identify potentially useful drugs, clinical trials are still necessary to confirm drug effectiveness. More significantly, the models’ performance in real-world situations is yet not proven, partly because some of the data used to train the model may recur in the test data.In conclusion, complementing the development of vaccines that can prevent an individual from catching the disease in the first place, computer models can be used to identify potentially effective drugs to treat the symptoms of Covid-19. So why has such a practical and efficient process been neglected? The simple reason is that it is not in the interests of the major pharmaceutical companies to encourage this kind of research. Drug repurposing challenges Big Pharma’s business model - which is based on charging high prices for ‘new’ premium products - by finding inexpensive yet effective ways to use existing products for new objectives. Worse, it risks publication of previously proprietary data, or, worst of all, revealing that a competitor’s product is more desirable. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has reframed the discussion. Collaboration is the order of the day. And collaboration is what computer modeling and computer scientists do best. They deserve generous funding.[1] "},{"title":"MIT Think 03","date":"2021-12-30T15:16:00.000Z","url":"/12/30/2021/20211213-MIT-3/","tags":[["Research","/tags/Research/"],["Machine learning","/tags/Machine-learning/"],["Modeling","/tags/Modeling/"]],"categories":[["Research","/categories/Research/"]],"content":"Final submission is really close.

Designed workflow of building the DeepPLA modelFigure 3. DeepPLA architectureI have built a preliminary version of DeepPLA according to the architecture shown in Figure 3. For model training, I am using data from the BindingDB (T. Liu et al., 2007) database with Ki value labels. BindingDB is a publicly accessible database that documents binding affinity measurements on the interactions for protein considered to be drug targets and small molecule drugs, with data curated from journal publications and open access sources. From a total number of 2,278,226 data (drug-protein interaction), I keep those with desired binding affinity Ki (490,605) and dropped low-quality entries, resulting with 249,517 data points. A summary of my data cleaning procedure is shown in Figure 4. For feature extraction, I am using two external embedding modules, Mol2Vec (Jaeger et al., n.d.) and ProSE (Bepler &amp; Berger, 2021), which are popular in drug development research, to convert structure data into numeric vectors. To stabilize the training process, I follow the literature and use Kaiming initializer (K. He et al., 2015a), L2-normalization, and LR decay (K. He et al., 2015b). Finally, to measure model performance, I will follow the literature and use mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation, coefficient of determination (R2, i.e., R-squared), and index of concordance (CI). (Öztürk et al., 2019) These metrics reflect the deviation of predictions from different perspectives.Some comparative statistics of my preliminary model against the state-of-the-art model DeepCDA are summarized in Table 1. As the table shows, DeepPLA manages to achieve an accuracy comparable to the benchmark, while significantly reducing the amount of time required to make predictions. Next, I plan to compare the model performance against more state-of-the-art models such as DeepDTA, and WideDTA, using different metrics. All models will be compared on equal ground with exactly the same data choice. I will also further evaluate the distribution of protein and molecular size and variety to resolve the differences in model performance. Table 1.

It would require too much time, but I managed to finish the future work and project budget. This is something interesting, and this is the first time I seriously make a budget for the research project and thinks about how much I have to spend and how to spend them wisely.Future WorkAlthough building my own model has been a fun task in and of itself, I hope to put my work to the test in solving real-world problems. First and foremost, I hope that DeepPLA can be applied to help medical researchers find a cure for COVID-19. To this end, my project still needs to overcome some challenges.Firstly, model precision is greatly determined by the choice of embedding algorithms. The embedding modules I am using currently, however, generate vector representations for the drugs and the proteins that are out of balance (300 elements for drug and 6165 elements for protein). This imbalance skews the model excessively toward the protein information, potentially resulting in lower precision. To solve this problem, I will experiment with different embedding algorithms. Recently I have my eyes on an exciting machine learning method, dual-learning that Microsoft developed for language translation. After communicating with the developer, I learned that this method has the potential for accurate and fast protein embedding, possibly enhancing the performance of my model.Secondly, to achieve higher precision, the model can be entirely reconstructed based on a new graph neural network approach. It is time-consuming, but it may be game-changing with outstanding performance while keeping the input simple. I would benefit from expert advice on how to optimize my model architecture.Lastly, the database I am currently using, BindingDB, does not provide access to commercial datasets, which contain more data relevant to finding a cure for COVID-19. This limitation renders the database less suitable to represent the entire knowledge on drug candidate molecules and COVID-19 proteins. Therefore, I hope to cooperate with drug-developing companies and test my model on their target protein. My research will also benefit from their feedback on DeepPLA’s prediction performance. Although I have made my model publicly accessible on Github for wider exposure, as a high school student, I find it hard to get feedback from end-users alone.I believe that my research can benefit a lot from the MIT THINK program, where I can meet creative minds and find inspiration for my work from their research. I appreciate the opportunity to connect with experts in related fields and receive their advice in optimizing my machine learning frameworks and in building better models to represent drug-target interactions. Opportunities to put me into contact with high-performance GPU clusters will also be a great benefit in speeding up model development.

I finished part of the writing on the motivations and Approach.Motivation and ApproachBy the end of 2021, COVID-19 has recorded more than 285 million confirmed cases and caused more than 5 million deaths globally. With waning immunity from vaccines and the emergence of new variants, there is still a huge need for effective drugs against the virus. (Giorgi et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020) Drug companies have prioritized the development of such drugs, but their progress still is not fast enough. (The Drug Development Process, 2018) After a prospective drug is found, researchers must identify and minimize the risk of possible side effects, as well as maximize the drug’s disease-fighting potency. Candidate drugs must go through several rounds of animal and human trials, and even if they are proven to be safe and effective, patience is needed before mass production. (Pushpakom et al., 2019; The Drug Development Process, 2018) This entire process costs great amounts of time and resources. As shown in Figure 1, based on a report in 2018, introducing new drugs into the market requires 10 to 20 years and more than 2 billion US dollars. (Pushpakom et al., 2019; Wouters et al., 2020) Figure 1. Drug Development Timeline of the normal process and the drug repurposing process, where the latter cost remarkably less development time.Drug repurposing is possibly a game-changer. Following this strategy, researchers intend to find a cure by repurposing existing drugs that have been approved for other diseases. (Pushpakom et al., 2019) Since it involves the use of de-risked compounds, drug repurposing is expected to lower the overall development costs and shorten the development timelines. (Pushpakom et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2017) However, it remains a challenge to test a large pool of approved drugs for their effectiveness against the virus. In other words, drug repurposing serves to shorten the R&amp;D cycle by reducing the risk factor, but identifying repurposable compounds from approved libraries, as shown in Figure 1, could still take 1 to 2 years. (Pushpakom et al., 2019; The Drug Development Process, 2018)When researchers search for repurposable drug candidates, a key measure is binding affinity, which represents the strength of the binding interaction between a viral protein to an anti-virus drug. (Ballester &amp; Mitchell, 2010; Singh et al., 2020) A stronger binding affinity means that the drug can inhibit the target protein more effectively than other compounds, suggesting a better chance of curing the infection. (Pushpakom et al., 2019) Thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms, drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction models are widely used to automate the searching process by scanning a large pool of existing drugs and predicting the interaction between drug molecular and protein sequence, promising to further shorten the development process. (Pushpakom et al., 2019)The DTI models currently used for drug repurposing strategies can be classified into two categories. The first category includes Simboost (T. He et al., 2017), DTiGEMS+ (Thafar et al., 2020), DeepDTA (Öztürk et al., 2018), DeepCDA (Abbasi et al., 2020), and similar models based on random forest (RF) (Li et al., 2015) and support vector machine (SVM) (Li et al., 2015). These models rely on features extracted by human experts in some pre-processing stage and are typically fast in making DTI predictions, being able to process up to thousands of drug-target pairs per day (Li et al., 2015; Özçelik et al., 2021). However, since the extraction of features requires human expertise, the lack of it may lead to the loss of valuable information of the drug molecules and protein sequence, resulting in low prediction precision. (Özçelik et al., 2021)The other type of models, such as Atomnet (Wallach et al., 2015) and SE-OnionNet(Wang et al., 2021), use 3-dimensional (3D) spatial structures of proteins and molecules for DTI predictions. While these models dramatically minimize the loss of information, they make predictions at a much slower rate, typically 1 drug-target pair per day. Moreover, in most databases, 3-D structure data are available for only a small fraction (0.2%-0.5%, depending on the database) of drug-protein pairs (Z. Liu et al., 2015). Due to data limitations, these models can only be applied to make DTI predictions in the specified database, whereas any real-world situation requires a model to be applied across different interaction mechanisms. (Wang et al., 2021) Low transferability is the main drawback of these models.In this project, I intend to construct a model, which I call DeepPLA, that achieves high precision and high transferability, while at the same time producing predictions at a fast rate. Instead of 3-D structure data which are rarely available in databases, I propose to use 1-D protein sequence and molecular SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) data. (Weininger, 1990) It may be a questionable approach to use 1-D protein sequence in medical research, but recent progress in computational models backs up this approach with strong outcomes. AlphaFold2 (The AlphaFold team, 2020), a model published by DeepMind, allows researchers to predict protein structure with sequence. The success of AlphaFold implies that we can make predictions based solely on the protein sequence. With this choice, my model can be trained with 20 to 500 times more data points for higher prediction accuracy, and the accessibility of new data points also makes my model applicable to targets previously ignored by state-of-the-art models, delivering higher transferability. (The AlphaFold team, 2020) To automate feature extraction, I will apply string-text-based embedding algorithms to ligand molecules and proteins separately, and feed the embedded numeric vectors into a stack of convolution neural networks and deep neural networks. Compared to the models like DeepDTA and DeepCDA (Abbasi et al., 2020; Öztürk et al., 2018), the string-text-based embedding algorithm conserves almost all of the information contained in the molecular and protein sequences, while lowering complexity. Finally, I will add Bi-LSTM layers that focus on partial interactions to capture detailed information."},{"title":"Little Oak management system mobile UI","date":"2021-11-24T14:14:00.000Z","url":"/11/24/2021/20211124-5/","tags":[["Volunteer","/tags/Volunteer/"],["Community Services","/tags/Community-Services/"]],"categories":[["Technique Sharing","/categories/Technique-Sharing/"]],"content":"We’ve done the website but from our survey we know mobile UI is really important.

Even though I am only a supporting role in this synthetic biology-based competition, it very much aligns with my personal values and the characteristics of computer science, that is, to become stronger in the process of helping others. More importantly, this competition has allowed me to make a lot of good friends for a lifetime. My friend Nick invited me to join their iGEM team to work on a synthetic biology project. What attracted me in iGEM is not the biological competition part, but rather being able support my friends with my modeling skills, and also the opportunity to work in a team over a long period of time for about a year.iGEM projects were challenging, and we always needed to work together in a team to tackle the challenge, like the wiki design and the modelling. Often we stayed up late together, and our friendship grew closer. This is the poster we finished for our project. I am proud of leading the modeling group. In October 2019, we attended the iGEM event Giant Jamboree in Boston, USA. There are so many people all round the world, and it is a totally new experience because the participants are from a wide range of backgrounds, including biological scientists, Human practices activists, and modeling and coding lovers like me. Presenting the poster with my teammates and friends was a thrilling and exciting experience. This is our first time going through the entire professional process of preparing posters, presentation scripts and mock interviews. We didn’t rest much on the first day we landed in US, not even for the jetlag. We raised questions to each other and practiced our interviews throughout the night. On the stage of final judging, I presented the modeling and coding part of the project to our judge group, including six judges from different backgrounds and countries. They did raise many challenging questions, and I think I did well! Near the end the the Jamboree event, high school team awards were announced. Our team won the Gold medal and nominated for best integrate Human Practice. Cheers to our team! This is the first iGEM gold medal we won. We were all very excited about our achievements. It was more than winning in a competition, but how we worked together and supported each other through difficult times. We promised that we would get together at least one every year after this, for our friendship lasts longer than the awards. Although we returned to our own schools after completing the competition, we would get together every once in a while. In 2020 and 2021, I joined the same iGEM team and worked in the modeling group, winning a silver medal in 2020 and a gold medal and ranking top 10 in 2021. I made new friends with new teammates. Again in 2022, I worked as the team advisor for the modeling aspect of the project.

My academic interests in engineering and computer science, my drive for solving real world problems with AI, and many of my best friends all dated back in the fourth grade when I first got in touch with VEX competitions. I feel it is the right time to recollect my VEX memories. By the first time I joined a VEX team, I was amazed at how smart and exciting to program a robotic machine to tackle the seemingly impossible tasks. In my team, I was the only one who loves both the robotics part and the programming part, and I naturally took the responsibility of programming designer in the team. I have been on the path of employing computational tools to tackle various challenge ever since. Amongst the many competitions I entered over the years, the most unforgettable one was my first time at the World Championship in the United States. I was deeply impressed by the many American families who teamed up to participate in. Although they only stopped their journey in the first round of game, but they were so happy and enjoyed the game from the deep heart. It seems the World Championship is not like a competition, but rather a gathering of VEX fans all over the world.Figure 1. It was the fourth grade in the primary school that I entered VEX competition first time in my life, starting a challenging but fun journey. Figure 2. In fifth grade, it was my first time to attend a competition out of the country. Our team won the silver medal in VEX Asia Tournament. Figure 3.

They are good questions to help people reflect deeply on what we had done. I am posting them here to share with everyone. What was the major objective of your project and what was your plan to achieve it?In the project, my work is based on the genome of the SARS-COV-2 virus which caused the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The major objective was to predict the genome mutation patterns using computational modeling. I expected the modeling would show us different patterns in different geographical regions and which sites could be the most important in affecting the mutation of the virus. The prediction might provide an alternative reference for other research and vaccine applications.In the spread of COVID-19, the mutation of the SARS-COV-2 virus has been found, and scientists imply that the mutation may affect the spread of the virus. So, I planned to predict the mutation and find out the characteristics of the mutation, and then develop a website to show the predicted results in real-time.To achieve this, my plan was as follows, as written in my research plan: Collect virus sequence data from the open-source database. Categorize the sequence mutation based on sampling locations as some reports indicated the mutation was regional. To predict the mutation trend, organize the data into time series, calculate mutation frequencies and disregard the low-frequency sites. Fit the data with the ARIMA model (a statistical model I used before) for prediction. Assess whether the mutations would cause amino acid changes or not. At last, build a website for others to access my prediction results and display the mutation trend in real-time automatically. a. Was that goal the result of any specific situation, experience, or problem you encountered?After the COVID-19 pandemic breakout in the US, the schools, including mine, had to close. During that time, I had to stay home and took online classes, and I checked the case counts hoping for the end of the disease. At school, I have interests in computer sciences, so I learned a lot of knowledge on building models using computer science, then I tried to build a model for predicting the cases of COVID-19. My mathematical supervisor introduced the ARIMA model to me and I found the model is working very well in predicting the cases of COVID-19 which is data with time series. After that, I started to think about what other predictions I could do. From the news, I learned that the virus had been continuing to mutate. Experts said that its pathogenicity and transmission are constantly changing with the mutation. Because most vaccines are using a special site on the virus genome to detect and bind with the protein to inhibit the activity of the virus, the mutations may affect the development of the vaccine and sometimes make the vaccine ineffective. And this gave me an idea that I can use my computer science and math skills to model the mutation rate for every genome site, and this would give me a mutation trend of the COVID-19 virus. And if I use the ARIMA model which I’ve learned from predicting cases on predicting the mutation rate of important sites for COVID-19, It can show different patterns of virus mutation in different countries. Such predictions might help scientists evaluate the tendency of mutation for each site, which could help them estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine in the long term and the possibility of using one vaccine which develops in one region in another region. b. Were you trying to solve a problem, answer a question, or test a hypothesis?I was trying to solve a problem that there’s no specific evaluation model on the possibility of mutation. Of course, it is based on a hypothesis that the virus mutation is predictable. What were the major tasks you had to perform in order to complete your project?Prior to the prediction:Before the prediction, data acquisition and data cleaning were very important and heavy.I had to compare and collect a sufficiently large amount of data from many different open-source websites to build a credible, accurate, and real-time database. I had to filter through all the data to make sure they contained necessary information without pre-processing.Communication was also very important, without sufficient communication, some problems may occur after you finish everything, and you may have to redo the entire thing.The first time when I obtained data from the CNCB database, the administration of the database suggests me to collect data from a special portal, it can give me every mutation data and the information of sequence in one file. Although the data had a special format inconsistent with data from other sources, I still spend a whole week understanding the format and building programs to extract information that I think is useful.However, after I use my code to format the data into what we can read, I found that the data have already been pre-processed, that all the back mutations were removed. But, the back mutation information was VERY important for my analysis, so I had to ask the administrator to point me to other data sources to restore the back mutation. And after he gives me the new data, I have to redo the entire thing to reformat the data again to what I can read and use.Prediction:After collecting data and translate it to what we can use, I can finally start my predictionCategorize data based on location. This is an important step but relatively easy to do. We classified those data according to continents because previous works showed the possibility of different trends in different continents.Organize data into time series and calculate the mutation frequency.Fit the data using the ARIMA model to obtain predictions. Because I should predict every single site separately, editing model parameters by hands would not be humanly possible. So, I designed an automatic parameter selection flow according to the ARIMA model and spent time building a program to automatically evaluate the parameters. For some predictions, data should also be truncated to remove the interference from low sampling numbers due to early reports (if a single new data will cause a more than 3% mutation rate change), because the mutation rate was calculated based on a single reference.Assess whether the mutations would cause amino acid changes. This task requires reading the genome sequence and find its corresponding amino acid changes from literature and data sources. a. For teams, describe what each member worked on.No team members were involved in this project. What is new or novel about your project?The novelty of this project is that I first proved that the virus mutation is predictable. Still, the mutation trends are different for different genome sites and different geographical locations.Secondly, most studies focused on the prediction of COVID-19 cases, and very few studies focus on single-site mutation prediction. I used a relatively simple model to predict the trends for each site which could be a useful innovation.Additionally, I used public data to proceed with this project. It can be called data reuse or data mining. In my project, a website is under construction to collect this public data, visualize it and make predictions in real-time to better popularize this important genetic information. a. Is there some aspect of your project’s objective, or how you achieved it that you haven’t done before?Yes, there are plenty of aspects that I haven’t done before. For example, although I used the model (ARIMA) before, applying the model on genome sequence mutation rate is something I haven’t done before. For past projects, I could apply modeling directly on the raw data; but in this project, I had to understand and calculated time series out of the raw data before modeling could be applied. Besides, the bioinformatics aspect of the project’s objective is another new challenge for me. I tried to combine knowledge of biology and mathematical modeling to solve prediction problems. The transformation and interpretation of knowledge brought about by inter-disciplinary have not been encountered in my previous studies. b. Is your project’s objective or the way you implemented it, different from anything you have seen?Yes, most of the website database which we have seen before is only showing the raw data or some processed data, such as GeneBank from NCBI (The National Center for Biotechnology Information), GISAID (a global science initiative and primary source) and CNCB-2019nCoVR (China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource) database. Most of them are focusing on showing the data in many statistical ways, however, they didn’t do the prediction on the mutation yet. c. If you believe your work to be unique in some way, what research have you done to confirm that it is?For start, I had done a literature review on COVID-19 predictions, and I find that most of them which may be related to my project are focusing on the statistic on SARS-COV-2, such as comparing the mutation of virus in a different region to trace to the source, or prediction on the cases number, or predictions on the effect of amino acids and proteins. Diverse mutation of virus in different regions is consistent with other reports which confirm the reliability of my results. What was the most challenging part of completing your project? In my project, the most difficult thing is to understand the expertise from vastly different research areas and to combine the knowledge.My project is a product entirely of my own design, and it is not aligned with any of the main research topics of my previous experience and all the researchers we were able to ask for help from. It is totally exciting to do it independently, but it is challenging for me to understand all the math, computer science, and biology knowledge from experts’ inputs and proceed with the project on my own with a few experts supervise and suggestions.Besides consulting to obtain suggestions and validate them by trial-and-error, I often needed to translate the computational based work into a different, biological language, describing the modeling reasoning in a way that can be understood by a bioinformatics researcher, or put the genome sequence data into something meaningful for a pure mathematician.Working on a new interdisciplinary project, without any professional forerunners, sometimes get me into communication issues (such as the terminology across different research areas that can cause misconception). For example, during the data collection, the data suggested by the biology experts did not meet the requirements suggested by my computer science advisor. I had to work carefully to validate all the data, suggestions, and requirements to make sure I did not train the model with some wrong data. Learning specialized research articles from different research areas was a big challenge. My solution was to put more effort and more time into the project. I checked new concepts on the web and read research articles over and over again. I also kept close contact with some experts and ask them for directions on how to learn that new knowledge.Combining knowledge from different research areas requires a lot of back-and-forth communications and validations. For example, for the biology questions – which important site may affect the structure of a virus, I would learn from a biology expert and used the biological criteria to select an important genome site. With that knowledge, I turned to an expert in math modeling and asked him for the suggestion on how to build models for quickly changing time series. The results of the modeling must be explained and validated in biology backgrounds, and I had to figure out the biological meaning of the parameters and predictions and explained to my biology advisor so we can validate the model and change the parameters and do another round of model fitting.During the programming, because the size of data was very large, I needed to build codes for the “batch” operation of a group of files, even for very simple tasks. I had to carefully debug the code and used unit-testing very frequently. b. What did you learn from overcoming these problems?I learned how to explain things in different ways to experts in different areas. Such as when I’m trying to explain the meaning of data to a modeling expert, I have to use the mathematical way to explain it. So, he can give me a more specific suggestion on how to design the model based on the mutation rate data. And after I built the model, I have to explain the predictions to biology experts using a biology tone. If you were going to do this project again, are there any things you would do differently the next time? I could choose to use and compare more professional models for prediction. Some other Machine learning models are reported to be very powerful in doing predictions for time series too, and if I have more time, I would add AI models into the predictions.With more knowledge on the biology data and database, I could more easily design a better data collection process so I will not waste time and effort on wrong data or wrong formats.Time management throughout the year. I would start the project earlier, to make time for other important school and science events during the project year. Working on this project gave me quite a lot of ideas in using mathematics and computer science in the biology area like using simple modeling for protein prediction and in the computer science area like using machine learning and AI for modeling and prediction on virus mutation or medical diagnosis."},{"title":"My tail","date":"2021-03-10T14:34:00.000Z","url":"/03/10/2021/20210310-3/","tags":[["Life","/tags/Life/"],["Family","/tags/Family/"],["Siblings","/tags/Siblings/"]],"categories":[["Life","/categories/Life/"]],"content":"We went shopping with little Apollo.

We have accumulated quite a lot of data, and they are openly accessible. I found some good data sources today. If we can investigate the mutation trends on each gene, on every site of RNA sequence, over the entire time from the first report, can we predict which site has the largest possibility to mutate in the future? I believe this will be useful for people who develops vaccines. I learned there will be a science fair near our schook next year in spring, the Mercer county science and engineering fair. It is affiliated with the ISEF, and this idea of predicting SARS-COV-2 gene mutation could be a very nice project to tackle some really difficult questions. This is called a Manhattan plot, showing in logarithmic form the relative mutation frequencies."},{"title":"Pets","date":"2020-10-07T06:32:00.000Z","url":"/10/07/2020/20191007/","tags":[["Life","/tags/Life/"],["Family","/tags/Family/"],["Siblings","/tags/Siblings/"]],"categories":[["Life","/categories/Life/"]],"content":"My brother has a dog, and I want to have a cat.

I read in the articles that machine learning can be helpful in fighting COVID-19, but I don’t exactly know how to do it yet. There are materials about machine learning techs, and the youtube videos and bilibili videos also look good in teaching myself some ML skills. Good thing it is coded in python.
